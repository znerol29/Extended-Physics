**AC Extended Physics**

Simple python script to backup and restore the surfaces.ini files of Assetto Corsa Tracks.
I personally had a problem with Assetto Corsa applying extended physics to every track when opening it,
which made the tracks unusable in multiplayer because of checksum mismatch.
The script can be both integrated with Content Manager or be used manually:

Content Manager:
Will add documentation later

Manual:
1. Enter your AC install directory (Will be saved in a seperate file)
2. Select the track you want to drive
3. Drive
